## üìù Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive operational dashboard built in Tableau for a power plant's chemical supply chain. The dashboard provides insights into order fulfillment, delivery performance, and production status from 2019 to the present day.

The primary goal is to empower management and logistics teams to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), identify bottlenecks in the supply chain, and analyze performance across different locations and chemical grades.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Insights

* **KPI Monitoring:** Tracks critical metrics like Total Orders, Average Delivery Time, and On-Time vs. Late delivery rates.
* **Order Status Analysis:** A clear breakdown of orders that are `Complete`, `Incomplete`, `Overdue`, or `Yet to Begin`.
* **Delivery Performance:** Compares `Actual Delivery Date` against `Estimated Delivery Date` to calculate delivery delays and identify early/late patterns.
* **Geographical Filtering:** Users can filter the entire dashboard by `Delivery State` and `City` to analyze regional performance.
* **Product & Production Analysis:** Allows for filtering by `Chemical Grade` and `Production Location` to see how different product types or facilities are performing.
